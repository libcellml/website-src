        <paragraph>In addition to creating id attributes, the <literal classes="code">Annotator</literal> can be used to clear them from all items in the model.
            There are two ways in which this can be done.
            First, a <literal classes="code">Model</literal> instance can be passed to the annotator for clearing.
            This process will replace any previously stored model with the new one, as well as clearing all ids from the given model.
            Alternatively, if a model is already stored in the annotator instance, the ids of that stored model can be cleared by calling the <title_reference>clearAllIds()</title_reference> function without arguments.</paragraph>
